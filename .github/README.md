## 🌐 Demo plugin of TransferProxy

This is a demo plugin for [TransferProxy](https://github.com/Darkkraft/TransferProxy/) using Gradle.

### ⚙️ What does this plugin do?

This plugin is a demo and should not be used in production. It only serves as an example to help developers use the TransferProxy API.

This plugin automatically transfers players to the server ``localhost:35565``. However, if the player has configured his client to use the left hand as the main hand, then he will be transferred 3 seconds later to the ``localhost:45565`` server.
